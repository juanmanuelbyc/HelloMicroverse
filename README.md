# HelloMicroverse

First project where applying best practices.

We are trying to apply all the best practices of gitHub Flow for the very first time in our projects.

This practice is about:
Documenting work in a professional way.
Create a new GitHub repo.
Create a new branch according to the GitHub flow rules.
Add a .gitignore file.
Set up a linter for HTML and CSS and make sure that any files that are not relevant are ignored by git.
Add descriptive README file to the project
Add 3 files (each one in a separate commit):
A .html file that includes a header with the text "Hello Microverse!". Use h1 tag for that.
A .css file that includes one class with styles for your header (make it in your favorite color).
A test.md file with the text "This file should be ignored by git".
Make sure that the last file is actually ignored by git and is not present in your GitHub repository.
Open a pull request.
